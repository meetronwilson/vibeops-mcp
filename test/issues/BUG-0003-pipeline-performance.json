  "description": "When a sales team has more than 200 active deals in the pipeline, the kanban board view becomes extremely slow and unresponsive. Dragging deals takes 3-5 seconds, and scrolling is janky. This impacts large sales teams and makes the feature unusable for enterprise customers.",

No memoization on card components. Drag-and-drop library (react-beautiful-dnd) has performance limitations with large lists.",
